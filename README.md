# A Mobile Application For Announcing the Birth or Death Of A Person
This project was done for Aalto University course CS-E5220 - User Interface Construction.
The basic idea of the task is to use UI design principles such as Gestalt Principles. In addition the interface is supposed to be interactive where the user gets assistance towards completing the task of announcing a birth or a death
The assistance for the application user is given in the form of short instructional error messages.
The UI is not the most aesthetic and some coding choices are repetitve as this project was done within 2 days with "minimum viable product" attitude.


## Stack Choices
The application has been built with the following base technologies:
* Typescript (and JavaScript)
* React-native
* React

Some libraries used wih the project
* React Navigation Stack
* Moment

## Future Development Options
Abstract coding components to make the project cleaner
Use more UI design principles to improve the UI
Generally spend more time with styling choices to build a more appealing looking UI
